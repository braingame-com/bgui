# BGUI - Brain Game User Interface

BGUI is an open-source, AI-first component library built with **React Native**. It aims to provide a universal toolkit for building applications across **iOS**, **Android**, **Web**, **Mobile Web**, and **Desktop (Electron)**.

## Mission

- **Accelerate human and AI developers** through well-structured code and comprehensive docs.
- **Enable financial freedom** by lowering the barrier to ship products rapidly.
- **Improve Brain Game's internal stack** via community contributions and real-world feedback.

## Features

- Universal components written once and deployed everywhere.
- Theming system with light/dark modes and platform-aware defaults.
- Layout primitives (`Flex`, `Grid`, `Stack`) for rapid UI composition.
- Utility hooks and platform-specific overrides.
- Built with LLM agents in mind via `@bgui-meta` annotations and rich inline comments.
